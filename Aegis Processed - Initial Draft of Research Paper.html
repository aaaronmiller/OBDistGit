# Initial Draft of Research Paper: Quantifying Architectural Cohesion and Contextual Degradation in LLM-Generated Code

**Authors:** [Your Name(s)], [Your Affiliation(s)]

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming software development by automating code generation. However, current evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on functional correctness, often overlooking critical aspects of software quality such as adherence to architectural patterns, coding standards, and the maintenance of structural integrity across extended development sessions. This paper introduces a novel framework for evaluating LLMs that precisely quantifies these aspects. Our methodology involves defining a "pattern-based coding structure" and encoding it into an LLM's system prompt. We then subject LLMs to sequences of interdependent coding commands, measuring "Prompt Adherence" (PA)—the degree to which generated code conforms to the defined structure—as a continuous metric. By tracking PA over increasing context lengths, we quantify "Context Window Degradation" (CWD) and "Degradation Rate" (DR), providing insights into an LLM's ability to maintain architectural cohesion and logical consistency over time. This framework offers a rigorous approach to understanding LLM limitations and capabilities for real-world software engineering, where architectural integrity is paramount.

## 1. Introduction
- **1.1 The Rise of LLMs in Code Generation:** Briefly describe the impact and potential of LLMs in software development.
- **1.2 Limitations of Current LLM Code Evaluation:** Lack of metrics for architectural adherence, code quality, and long-term structural consistency.
- **1.3 The Problem of Context Window Degradation:** Explain why maintaining context and architectural understanding is crucial for multi-turn coding.
- **1.4 Our Proposed Solution:** Introduce the "Structural & Contextual Cohesion Benchmark" framework.
- **1.5 Contributions:** A novel methodology for defining and enforcing pattern-based coding structures, formalization of Prompt Adherence (PA), a method for measuring Context Window Degradation (CWD), and insights into LLM architectural cohesion.

## 2. Background and Related Work
- **2.1 LLM Code Generation & Benchmarking:** Overview of models and benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP), and limitations of "Pass@k" metric.
- **2.2 LLM Architectural Specification & Style Adherence:** Review current research and highlight the gap in quantifiable adherence as a continuous metric.
- **2.3 Long Context LLM Evaluation:** Overview of "Needle-in-a-Haystack" (NIAH) and LongCodeBench, and how this work moves beyond simple retrieval to architectural consistency.
- **2.4 Automated Consistency Analysis of LLMs:** Discuss research on evaluating LLM consistency and applying it to code's structural integrity.

## 3. Proposed Framework: Structural & Contextual Cohesion Benchmark
- **3.1 Defining the Pattern-Based Coding Structure (P):** Elaborate on the types of patterns and methods for formalizing them.
- **3.2 Encoding P in the System Prompt:** Strategies for injecting P into the LLM's system prompt.
- **3.3 Testing Methodology:** Detail the design of sequential, interdependent commands and multi-model testing.
- **3.4 Quantifiable Metrics:** Formal presentation of PA, CWD, and Cohesion Loss (CL) formulas and the Automated Adherence Checker.

## 4. Potential Challenges and Mitigations
- **Complexity of P Definition & Prompting:** Mitigation through hierarchical definitions and exemplar-based learning.
- **Robustness of Automated Adherence Checker:** Mitigation through multi-level analysis and human-in-the-loop validation.
- **Isolation of Degradation Factors:** Mitigation through control tasks and error categorization.

## 5. Implementation Requirements
- **Expertise:** LLM/AI, Software Architecture, Programming Language Parsers, Data Science, DevOps.
- **Tools & Infrastructure:** LLM API access, Prompt Management System, Custom Static Analysis Engine, Results Database, Benchmarking & Visualization Platform.
- **Test Case Dataset:** Meticulously designed sequential coding tasks.

## 6. Enhancements and Future Work
- AI-Assisted Pattern Definition & Refinement.
- Interactive Degradation Debugging & Explainability.
- "Self-Correction Loop" Testing for Degradation Recovery.
- Multi-Language and Framework Support.
- Economic Cost Analysis of Adherence & Degradation.
- Open-Sourcing the Benchmark Framework.

## 7. Conclusion
Summarize the unique contributions and the significance of the framework, reiterating its potential to advance LLM evaluation for robust software development.
