        <div class="section">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Torrential rains triggered catastrophic flash flooding in Kerr County, Texas, along the Guadalupe River, with the river surging <span class="highlight">26 feet in 45 minutes</span>. Up to <span class="highlight">10–15 inches</span> of rain fell overnight, causing at least <span class="highlight">24 deaths</span> and leaving <span class="highlight">23–25 girls</span> missing from Camp Mystic.</p>[](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2025/07/04/guadalupe-river-flooding-deaths-texas-kerrville/84470317007/)[](https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/texas-flooding-07-04-2025)
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Flood Duration and Recession</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Peak Height</span>: The Guadalupe River surged from 7 to over 29 feet in less than 2 hours, peaking around 4:35 a.m. on July 4, 2025. The exact duration at peak is unclear due to gauge failure, but likely brief.</li>[](https://www.newsweek.com/central-texas-flooding-live-tracker-maps-2094900)
                <li><span class="highlight">Recession</span>: Waters began receding in some areas within an hour (e.g., Camp Mystic), but remained high into July 5, with the river near Spring Branch cresting at 37.2 feet at 2 a.m. Complete recession likely took hours to days.</li>[](https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/texas-flooding-07-04-2025)
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Affected Area</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Geographic Scope</span>: Flooding centered in Kerr County (1,107 sq miles), impacting Hunt, Kerrville, Ingram, and Center Point along the Guadalupe River. Neighboring Kendall and Tom Green counties also affected.</li>[](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2025/07/04/guadalupe-river-flooding-deaths-texas-kerrville/84470317007/)[](https://www.newsweek.com/central-texas-flooding-live-tracker-maps-2094900)
                <li><span class="highlight">Flood Corridor</span>: Affected a 20–30-mile river corridor from Hunt to downstream communities. Low-lying areas, camps, and neighborhoods like Bumble Bee Hills were hardest hit.</li>[](https://www.tpr.org/2025-07-04/kerr-county-residents-urged-not-to-travel-unless-seeking-higher-ground-along-guadalupe-as-severe-flooding-leads-to-fatalities)

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Population Impacted</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Kerr County Population</span>: ~52,598 (2020 Census). Thousands affected due to evacuations, property damage, and infrastructure disruption.</li>[](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/07/04/us/texas-floods-guadalupe-river)
                <li><span class="highlight">Casualties</span>: At least 24 deaths, with 23–25 girls missing from Camp Mystic (750 campers). 237 people rescued, 167 by helicopter.</li>[](https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/texas-flooding-07-04-2025)[](https://www.foxnews.com/us/devastating-texas-river-flood-leaves-least-6-dead-emergency-crews-race-find-others-missing)

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Historical Comparison</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Last Major Event</span>: The 1987 Guadalupe River flood (11 inches of rain, 10 deaths) was the closest comparable event, 38 years prior. The 2025 flood surpassed it in intensity.</li>[](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/07/04/texas-flooding-extreme-rains/)[](https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2025/07/04/fatalities-confirmed-in-kerr-county-flooding-along-guadalupe-river-sheriffs-office-says/)
                <li><span class="highlight">Unprecedented Speed</span>: The 2025 event’s 26-foot rise in 45 minutes was faster than 1987, making it a rare catastrophe.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Likelihood of Recurrence</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Risk Factors</span>: Texas Hill Country’s hilly terrain and dry soils increase flash flood risk. The 2025 event was a 1-in-100-year flood, but climate change may raise future likelihood.</li>[](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/04/weather/texas-flooding-climate)
                <li><span class="highlight">Future Outlook</span>: More rain was forecast through July 5, with ongoing risks from San Antonio to Waco. Improved forecasting and infrastructure could mitigate future events.</li>[](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/officials-confirm-deaths-after-flash-floods-central-texas-2025-07-04/)

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why It Wasn’t Dealt with Properly</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Underestimated Forecasts</span>: NWS predicted 1–5 inches, but 10–15 inches fell, overwhelming preparations.</li>[](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2025/07/04/guadalupe-river-flooding-deaths-texas-kerrville/84470317007/)[](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/officials-confirm-deaths-after-flash-floods-central-texas-2025-07-04/)
                <li><span class="highlight">Rapid Onset</span>: Flooding began pre-dawn, with a 26-foot surge in 45 minutes, limiting evacuation time.</li>[](https://www.newsweek.com/texas-flooding-harris-kerr-guadalupe-river-weather-warning-2094777)
                <li><span class="highlight">Infrastructure Issues</span>: The USGS gauge failed at 4:35 a.m., and dry soils increased runoff.</li>[](https://www.tpr.org/2025-07-04/kerr-county-residents-urged-not-to-travel-unless-seeking-higher-ground-along-guadalupe-as-severe-flooding-leads-to-fatalities)[](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/04/weather/texas-flooding-climate)

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why It Was a Surprise</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Unpredictable Scale</span>: The rapid 26-foot rise and 10–15 inches of rain exceeded forecasts, driven by Tropical Storm Barry’s remnants.</li>[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_2025_Central_Texas_floods)
                <li><span class="highlight">Holiday Timing</span>: The July 4 holiday increased visitors, complicating response.</li>[](https://www.newsweek.com/central-texas-flooding-live-tracker-maps-2094900)
                <li><span class="highlight">Comparison to 1987</span>: The 2025 flood’s speed outpaced the 1987 event, catching authorities off guard.</li>[](https://www.kens5.com/article/weather/weather-floods-kerrville-july-4-texas-evacuations/273-361090c5-4352-4e2d-84ba-3adcf2007354)
